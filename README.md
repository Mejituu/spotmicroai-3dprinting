## Change Log

Version 1.03 - Febuary 20, 2020

All the following changes based in the Version 1.02

- Made the body 6cm longer
- Shoulders now symetricals and simple to unassemble for maintenance if needed, since they have the screws facing the user, in v1.02 for the rear shoulder was neccesary to unassemble the body to access the rear servos.
- Covers perimeters have been shorten 0.3mm, so the actuation/movement of the servos don't touch them.
- Foot has been improved, now is symetrical and has +1mm clearance for easy gluing.
- Added a support in the shoulders cables hole to avoid cables to be touching the legs as they move inwards to the body (till 35ยบ max)
